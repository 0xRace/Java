167.  This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. https://t.co/N5815RS1At
168.  Victory press conference was over. 
Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? https://t.co/qbW2RjkINX
169.  Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
170.  Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
171.  How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
172.  I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
173.  Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
174.  We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
175.  Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
176.  Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates
177.  After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
178.  "@PaulaDuvall2:  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood, he'll be against it!"

196.  Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
197.  Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
198.  Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
199.  Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
200.  Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
201.  The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
202.  The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
203.  "@pattiandsammi: @gullakhta99 @realDonaldTrump @Tytan01 @CNN WOMEN LOVE TRUMP. TRUMP'S EXECS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE. #WOMEN4TRUMP"
204.  "@Tytan01: Dear @CNN, after doing a quick Google & Twitter search there are over 15,000 women's groups supporting DonaldTrump. Stop Lying."
205.  "@SpartanMaker:  Let me help you Trumpophobes with math: Trump: ($10.3B-$1.2M 74' equity)/1.2M = 858,233%. S&P: 1314.5% #Derp"
206.  "@stanColtrane: Turns out @glennbeck was wrong. @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with it https://t.co/svSKfiDkdf"
207.  "@theAgeofLeo: Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined."
208.  Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!
209.  "@11phenomenon: #LyingTed blames @realDonaldTrump for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis."
210.  Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
211.  I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!
212.  Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!

216.  Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
217.  Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
218.  "@Doctor_S_Freud:  @TheView They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show
219.  Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
220.  .@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO"
221.  Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!

223.  It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!
224.  Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!
225.  These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!
226.  .@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!
227.  It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
228.  "@missi51: .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people."
229.  We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
230.  N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

237.  While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
238.  I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
239.  I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I‚Äôm the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin‚Äô Ted & others are copying me.
240.  Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She‚Äôs been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
241.  Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can‚Äôt blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
242.  Lyin‚Äô Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas‚Äî just another dishonest politician.

244.  Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
245.  Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
246.  Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!

248.  Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
249.  Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
250.  Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!
251.  Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.

268.  The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
269.  Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD!

309.  Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
310.  Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
311.  Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary

328.  The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
329.  Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
330.  Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating

378.  Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
379.  I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
380.  Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

396.  The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people!
397.  Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
398.  Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
https://t.co/08xkEBD8Be
399.  Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive! 
https://t.co/1rmyCGSlsV
400.  Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel
401.  Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
402.  Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
403.  "@alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!!"
404.  Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem!
405.  RT @GovMikeHuckabee: Trump says the chaos in Chicago was a planned attack. But Hillary insists it was a spontaneous reaction to an internet‚Ä¶
406.  USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true
407.  Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way

410.  It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
411.  The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
412.  We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. 
No way to run a country!
413.  Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
414.  The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!

418.  The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio!
419.  Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
420.  Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico!
421.  The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!

635.  I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!
636.  Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!
637.  I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!
638.  Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!

653.  Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
654.  Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
655.  Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!

837.  Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home.
838.  .@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
839.  I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
840.  .@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.

862.  JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician! 
https://t.co/yZT3lSutt9
863.  Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
https://t.co/eiBCld77tV
864.  I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
865.  Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
866.  I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
867.  Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
868.  Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
869.  Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
870.  Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
871.  Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!
872.  Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints

928.  How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?

936.  We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!
937.  Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
938.  He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
939.  Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
940.  .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!
941.  Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
942.  There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
943.  I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!

966.  No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
967.  I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
968.  Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

1053.  Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
1054.  The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

1056.  I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
1057.  Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
1058.  And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
1059.  The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
1060.  Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
1061.  During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
1062.  Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

1270.  Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
1271.  Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
1272.  Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
1273.  The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

1372.  Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes.

1374.  Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
1375.  Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
1376.  Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
1377.  The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
1378.  Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
1379.  Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
1380.  Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
1381.  More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

1444.  Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
1445.  UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
1446.  This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
1447.  If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn‚Äôt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can‚Äôt win.

1554.  I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
1555.  Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
1556.  Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
1557.  .@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

1640.  Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!
1641.  Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
1642.  Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!
1643.  The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

1691.  Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
1692.  Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
1693.  Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
1694.  Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
1695.  In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
1696.  Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

1947.  Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor. Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!
1948.  Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
1949.  RT @tedcruz: The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match. 

Sorry to disappoint -- @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt
1950.  Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
1951.  Great news in Georgia!  The just out  Landmark poll shows me in first with 43%! Wow. https://t.co/mG6uZQxBWG https://t.co/UZ03GJDvOV
1952.  Our spectacular ballroom under construction at the great Turnberry resort in Scotland. https://t.co/QmXD8kHFhS
1953.  .@chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning!  I fixed his rating problem.
1954.  .@Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time
1955.  .@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
1956.  Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!
1957.  .@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!
1958.  Great evening last night in  New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory, great people! Thank you.
1959.  .@BernardGoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor. He just doesn't know about winning! But he is a nice guy.

1968.  Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead. New Fox poll has me beating Hillary.
1969.  Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements. He still thinks Romney won--he should get a life!

1978.  Wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof!
1979.  .@Megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me. Really weird, she's being driven crazy!
1980.  "@jimparkey: @realDonaldTrump @donlemon @CNN great interview! Speaking calmly but carrying a heavy stick!" Thank you!
1981.  Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I.Q. test. Dumb as a rock!  @CNN

1989.  Great leaders listen to and support law enforcement officials. Police discuss no-go areas: https://t.co/hEM6UGuiTs https://t.co/VmkTnHcwto
1990.  Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue. I hear she will soon be gone!
1991.  .@secupp, who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on T.V. Hard to watch, zero talent! @CNN
