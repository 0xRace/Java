/**
 * These comments are an example of the types of comments that I will expect you to write for all labs 
 * henceforth.  You are required to write a Javadoc comment for all classes and for all methods, as well as 
 * comments that describe all parameter variables.  To add a method comment in Java, put your cursor inside
 * the method and select "Edit" and "Add method comment".
 * 
 * The triangle class contains methods which compute the perimeter and area of a triangle.
 *
 * It has two constructors.  These are examples of overloaded constructors (two or more constructors that 
 * take different parameters).  The appropriate constructor will be called based on what parameters
 * are provided by the client class.  I have asked you to instantiate a Triangle object using the no-args
 * constructor.
 * 
 * This class also contains a mutator (or setter) method.  The client class (TriangleRunner) will use this method to
 * set the side lengths.
 * 
 * I have provided all required methods.  Your job is to complete these methods with the appropriate 
 * code.
